Even if you are a bad shifter you still wont damage the car/engine with that

No Engine damage from RPM.

Not possible to get Red or Yellow Engine damage from collisions

Zombies and Animals can get run over by a car

Players cant get run over by a car

Players also wont take damage if entering or leaving a car when its on/running
